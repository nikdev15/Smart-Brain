<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
There are many projects being built by awesome developers everyday, however, this is a project that I had personally envisioned as I had started learning to code. This project projects my skills as a full-stack developer using the latest tools. I was always fascinated by the face recognition software used in camera's and mobile's. This project is a result of that fascination and my coding skills combined to make an app of my own that implements the face recognition to photos.

I think this is a cool project, Here's why:

<ul>
  <li> This project is scalable and very light which adds to its advantage of being awesome.<li>
  <li> This project uses an API service that is constantly updated and new features can br incorporated easily.</li>
  <li> This project is made keeping in mind the concept of reusable components, which makes the code reusable in other projects as components.</li>
</ul>
